# Library

Task was to create a list view that allows a user to browse and borrow books based on sample XML data using Spring Boot.

##Business requirements were as follows:
  
Books that have been borrowed, should clearly display who has borrowed them
Prevent others from also checking out the same book until it has been returned
Users should be able to filter only available/free books
Filtering based on author, title, description, and published date should also be an option
