# Library

Task was to create a list view that allows a user to browse and borrow books based on sample XML data using Spring Boot.

## Business requirements were as follows:
  
Books that have been borrowed, should clearly display who has borrowed them <br/>
Prevent others from also checking out the same book until it has been returned <br/>
Users should be able to filter only available/free books <br/>
Filtering based on author, title, description, and published date should also be an option <br/>

## Technical requirements were as follows:

Write your implementation in Java for Web, preferably using Spring Boot (https://start.spring.io/) <br/>
Focus on backend implementation, not so much on look and feel (CSS) <br/>
Follow the MVC pattern and focus on the separation of concerns <br/>
Make sure to split the UI from business logic <br/>
Make your code understandable, maintainable, and reusable <br/>
Write integration and/or unit tests based on your personal preference <br/>
